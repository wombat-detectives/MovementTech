# Super Hubert 64
Unity 3D Platforming game made for the Itch.io Game Off 2024

## Theme: Secrets
This theme is implemented through "secret" movement tech that allow you to move faster, jump higher, or outright clip through walls. By giving environmental cues along with some hints from in-game NPCs, we aim for the player to learn these mechanics themselves for a "eureka" moment.

We also fulfill one of the wildcards by incorporating a speedrun timer for each star so that you can challenge yourself to beat each level faster than before.

## Features
Movement is done using a fully physics force-driven rigidbody system, using this approach means the player is not restricted by any hard speed limits, and as long as they can combine forces through their various abilities they can move as fast as they want.
- WASD movement.
- Auto Bhop to maintain more speed than on the ground.
- Dash mid air for a small boost of speed.
- Slide on slopes to gain a lot of momentum.
- Jumping off angled ground will change your jump angle, allowing for an extra boost.
- Wall ride and wall climb on climbable surfaces.

## Levels
- Tutorial level to teach you the basics
- Hub world to navigate between levels, and track your progress.
- Grass/Island level, dodge wrecking balls, do super long wall rides, and climb the lighthouse to grab 2 keys for the castle gate.
- Sand level, climb the pyramid, clip into the Sphynx's secret room, and bounce off cacti to collect the other 2 keys.
- (Planned, but not finished due to scope) Castle level, a vertical level where you need to outrun the rising lava and reach the end where the biggest secret of this game's nature is revealed.
